float_is_close.py

A simple proof of concept for float_is_close.c in pure python

NOTE: Requires python 3.7 or greater

NOTE: This is a minimalistic dependency.

NOTE: If tests, or further extentions are to be implemented,
      then there should be no other dependency than the builtin
      standard library.
